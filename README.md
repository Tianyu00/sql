```
SELECT population FROM world
  WHERE name = 'Germany'
```

```
SELECT name, population FROM world
  WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');
```

```
SELECT name, area FROM world
  WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000
```

quiz

```
SELECT name, population
  FROM world
 WHERE population BETWEEN 1000000 AND 1250000
```

```
SELECT name, population
      FROM world
      WHERE name LIKE "Al%"
```

```
SELECT name FROM world
 WHERE name LIKE '%a' OR name LIKE '%l'
```

```
SELECT name,length(name)
FROM world
WHERE length(name)=5 and region='Europe'
```

```
SELECT name, area*2 FROM world WHERE population = 64000
```

```
SELECT name, area, population

 WHERE area > 50000 AND population < 10000000
```

```
SELECT name, population/area
  FROM world

## SELECT from WORLD Tutorial
```
SELECT name, continent, population FROM world
```

```
SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population >= 200000000
```

```
SELECT name, gdp/population
FROM world
WHERE population >= 200000000
```

```
SELECT name, population/1000000
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'South America'
```

```
SELECT name, population
FROM world
WHERE name IN ('France', 'Germany', 'Italy')
```

```
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%United%'

```
SELECT name, population, area
FROM world
WHERE area > 3000000 OR population > 250000000
```

```
SELECT name, population, area
FROM world

              (area <= 3000000 AND population > 250000000)
`` seems also works:
WHERE area > 3000000 XOR population > 250000000
WHERE (area > 3000000) <> (population > 250000000)
WHERE (area > 3000000) != (population > 250000000)
```

```
SELECT name, ROUND(population/1000000,2), ROUND(gdp/1000000000,2)

SELECT name, ROUND(gdp/population/1000,0)*1000
FROM world
WHERE gdp >= 1000000000000
```

```
SELECT name, capital
  FROM world
 WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital)
```

```
SELECT name, capital
FROM world
WHERE (LEFT(name,1) = LEFT(capital,1)) AND (name <> capital)
```

```
SELECT name
   FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%a%' AND
              name LIKE '%e%' AND

## SUM and COUNT
### Using SUM, Count, MAX, DISTINCT and ORDER BY
### Using GROUP BY and HAVING
```
SELECT SUM(population)
FROM world
```

```
SELECT DISTINCT continent 
FROM world
```

```
SELECT SUM(gdp)
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Africa'
```

```
SELECT COUNT(name)
FROM world
WHERE area >= 1000000
```

```
SELECT SUM(population)
FROM world
WHERE name IN ('Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania')
```

```
SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
FROM world
GROUP BY continent
```

```
SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
FROM world
WHERE population >= 10000000
GROUP BY continent
```

```
SELECT continent
FROM world
GROUP BY continent
HAVING SUM(population) >= 100000000
```

quiz

```
